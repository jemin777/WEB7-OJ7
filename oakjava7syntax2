OakJava7 Syntax 2
==================


Filename.java7

================

public  class  <classname>


{


//This constructor with super method is mandatory, which indicates it is a oakjava7 //program

// This  constructor  should have same name  as  the  classname .

public  <classname>() 

{ 


super();


}


// it means it will not support any java compiler, it is entirely different.


public void main()


{


<! OAKJAVA7 Logic !>


}


}


Example:

Query3.java7


 class Query3

{

	public Query3()

	{

		super();

         }

// Method declared for this  Oakjava7 program to print

//the text Welcome! to EveryBody


      public void displayhtmltoweb(String a)

{

//print is  to print the text or html GUIS

print("\n\n");

print("<HTML><script> </script><body bgcolor=green> Welcome!</body></html>"++a);


print("\n\n");



}


// All the oakjava7 main method  should have public void main() instead of

 //public static void main method  of java language.

        public void main()

	{

// call the displayhtmltoweb


displayhtmltoweb(" to EveryBody");

}

}


Note:
=====

This  is  simillar  to  Java Servlet , This  topic  is  mentioned only at  Enterprise  edition. And  this program generated  class file  is  sealed  as

"An Oakjava7(JAVA7.0) compiler - jemin Information  technology - JIT-777-WRIT-0003 Query3.class" .  So this  is another type of oakjava7 program 

and  it is called as  Oakjava7 Servlet.



JAVA7.0  SYNTAX-2  Program  Structure(.java7)

Declaration Oakjava7  Section  : 

 public class  <classname>

{

//This constructor with super method is mandatory, which indicates it is a oakjava7 //program and  class name and   constructor name should be  same

public  <classname>() 

{ 

super();

}

Documentation  Section 

// it means it will not support any java compiler, it is entirely different.

Package  Statement;

Import  Statement;

OAKJAVA7 LOGIC  SECTION

// Oakjava7  main method should have public void main  method  otherwise oakjava7

program  will not  compile....

   public void main()

{

<! OAKJAVA7 Logic !>

}

CLOSE OAKJAVA7  LOGIC  SECTION   }

LOGIC  OAKJAVA7  DATASTRUCTURE SECTION

class  <CLASSNAME>

{


private <CLASSNAME>()

	{

		super();

	}

................

................

................


CLOSE LOGIC OAKJAVA7 DATASTRUCTURE SECTION }


ENDING  SECTION : 


Explanation:
============

All  JAVA7.0   should    start    oakjava7  declaration section as


public class  <classname>

{

//This constructor with super method is mandatory, which indicates it is a oakjava7 program. 
//The class name and  constructor  of  Oakjava7 program should be  same.

public  <classname>() 

{ 

super();

}   

after that OAKJAVA7 LOGIC  SECTION should be

   public void main()

{

<! OAKJAVA7 Logic !>

}

so <!OAKJAVA7 Logic>  may have print statements, for loop,

Datastructure statements belong to  another class.

But Logic  Oakjava7  DataStructure Section should be in this format

class  <CLASSNAME>

{


private <CLASSNAME>()

	{

		super();

	}

and Close Logic Oakjava7 DataStructure section by using   curly braces which is "}".

I hope  this  syntax  change  will be  easy  to  follow  and  to  do programming  

in Oakjava7. I remove the  complexity of  the  oakjava7  program syntax. So now

this  type  of  oakjava7 servlet  syntax  is  learnable.

Note:
=====

This  Oakjava7Syntax2  is  used  for  Oakjava7 Servlet, etc.
This  syntax  is  easy to focus and it is  learnable.
and it  generates .class file  which  will be  sealed  with 
"An Oakjava7(JAVA7.0) compiler - jemin Information  technology - JIT-777-WRIT-0003 Query3.class" .  

So this  is another type of oakjava7 program  and  it is called as  Oakjava7 Servlet.
and it  has main mehtod  as public void main only.
