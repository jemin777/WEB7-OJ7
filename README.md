OJAVA7(JAVA7.0) Tutorial
===========================

OJAVA7(JAVA7.0) Programming Language is  invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013,2016 in  java(jdk1.6) ,DOTWEB3.0. and OJAVA7(JAVA7.0)  is  a   World Rank A' Programming Language and  it  is   focused  on   creating  DataStructures,Console Application with Wnosql DB, and
 used  in  web application and Used in Remote X application  and  it  has  Advanced Oops.But OJava7 windows application is  present in JDollarShell
 not present in OJava7(JAVA7.0). OJava7(JAVA7.0) has Advanced concept like Bucket,Extend,etc. But in JdollarShell only J$Shell GUI,Graphics are
 found. Remote X application is Advanced than Python,Webapplication,and all programming Languages.So Say Good bye to olden web application.
  OakJava7 is otherwise known as OJava7.Because many Tech Guys think it as java7 version. 
 
 It is used in Remote X application which is not opensource.Because Remote X application is
different from webapplication and this concept is  invented by Wilmix Jemin j.This Remote X application and
Remote web Application are not one. Remote web application is advanced than  remote X application.
This  Remote X Application and  Remote Webapplication is  confidental from illegal hackers or another illegal persons who
want to copy all my features in their research product and they will implement it.

 It  also  supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it  is Learnable.It is  easy to learn.
JAVA7.0   means   Jemin  Advanced  Virtual  Application.
JAVA7.0   is  even   Advanced   than  Python Programming  language and  all programming Languages.
OakJava7(JAVA7.0) Linux version  is  implemented  in  C/C++, Java,Dotweb3.0 at  year  2021.  



Definition:
==========

â€œOJAVA7   is  meant   for  obfuscation, Code Security, Learnable,jclass type software, Advanced , used  in
Software  development, web application with machine learning  , and  it  symbolizes  
STAR  symbol,  used  in  applications  like   consolee and  used  with  java/j2ee  framework  like
mybatics,and hibernate  and JAVA7.0 is used  in Machine Learning and  Datascience ,It is  also
used  to  create  single webapplication".
          
The Meaning of OJAVA7  is O + Jemin Advanced Virtual Machine  OAK gives the meaning Beginning.

What is the Expansion of JAVA7.0 Programming Language ?
=======================================================

Expansion of JAVA7.0 is

J stands for Jemin , A stands for Advanced , V stands for Virtual , 

and A stands for Application , 7 -> stands for wise Programming Language,
and O stands for Olive




ABOUT JAVA7.0
=============


JAVA7.0 Programming  Language   is otherwise  known  as  OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0)
  which is  invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013 in  java ,DOTWEB3.0.
This   two  versions  of  JAVA  (Jdk1.8,jdk1.7)  failed  that  is  using  JAD  decompiler  we  can   
easily  take   the  source   code.. But using oakjava7  we  can't take the code.
We  felt   thanks  to my  best  friends  venkat  friend ,  github ,  and  all  for  their   support..


ADVANTAGES of OJAVA7(JAVA7.0)
=================================

a) JAVA7.0 behaves like his parent java and Dotweb3.0

java fails completly in code security. 

but java(jdk1.8,jdk1.7) is used with JREE in linux platform.

b) JAVA7.0 supports Garbage collection and explicity memory.

c) JAVA7.0 support Multiple inheritance ,friend function, and operator overloading

and all C/C++ oops concepts.

d) JAVA7.0 also supports CDollar concepts.

e) JAVA7.0 is used to create games which cannot be achieved in cdollar and gdollar.

f) JAVA7.0 also includes Java oops concepts.

g) JAVA7.0 also follows attractive syntax.

h) JAVA7.0 have  100% oops concepts. 

i) JAVA7.0 is used with DotWeb3.0,CWEB section, and  Java.

j) OakJava7(JAVA7.0)  provides high security for  Web / Remote-X application

k) OJava7(JAVA7.0) contains Optimized code.
l)  We know   Tree  datastructures  are  more complex to solve it  for  any Programming Language
OakJava7 (JAVA7.0)   can   easily solve  this  complex  datastructures  like  Drag and  drop  the 
child  of tree1 and  put  that child in  another  tree , CRUD  operations  in  Tree,etc.

m)   In  case  of  programming  language  like  C# or Java or PHP or Python or  anyother P.L  ; 
source  code  can be  taken  using  code reflector  for c++, C#. For  Java , Code  can  be  taken using  JAD compiler 
, and for  other programming  language. For Php,Python  Code security  is  absent. 
.But  OakJava7  source  code  cannot  be  taken . So    Oakjava7   are   the  most  securable  programming 
Language. So no need   to worry  about   code  security. Oakjava7 will work in
Windows and LInux type  platforms.

Note: You  can see remaining  advantages  in  Oakjava7 Website which is given below....
This tutorial website  is under  construction.


n) Due to  this  High security Remote -X Application , High security Webapplications ,Other Advantages,
and  Other Concepts  So it is Ranked as World Rank A' Programming Language

Note: OJava7  has  more  advantages than i  given  above..





Did Ojava7 has limitations?
===========================





No,Ojava7 did not have any limitations.The reasons for it are given below...


1) Once you study Java/j2ee you can easily

write a  program in ojava7.


2) Ojava7 is a new Programming Language

in SIT field.A useless software should be

replaced by a good software. As we change

our shirt every day so C/C++,pascal,foxpro or olden 

softwares  should be replaced by new one.This

is what SIT focus. Computer field should be a

learnable field. 


3) Ojava7 did not focus on AI (Artificial Intelligence)

because AI is a antichrist technology..So Ojava7 did not follow AI, instead of that RAI is used. As written in bible book of revelation 13 -> Image represent ROBOT will kill all the people ,business man ,etc in this World who accepts lord jesus christ as Lord.So robot is an antichrist technology.AI is replacing human jobs.This AI is very dangerous technology.


4) Remote X application is a new concept.After machine learning,etc, all are released.

In Oakjava7 Remote X application we can use

with java framework like Hibernate,JPA,and Jdk compiler

like Jdk1.8,Java 11, and Jdk17. But Ojava7 will work faster

than C/C++.For Remote X application instead we use

<WEB> , tech guys should use <J7Remote>.

If you know OJ7UA framework then it is very easy

to focus Ojava7 Remote X application.only the

Syntax <WEB> or <JAVA> is  replaced by <J7Remote>

remaining syntax of .oj7ua or .web will not change.

So their is no new to learn for Ojava7 Remote X application. So learning ojava7 Remote X application may not need  any additional effort.

5) Ojava7 has Good performance. Because it is faster

and have Good Memory Management. In enterprise edition you can learn

depth about Ojava7 memory management topics. So Ojava7 saves time

and it has Good performance.

6) Ojava7 did not have any compactibility issues,

why because it will work on any browsers.

7) Ojava7 is the Powerful/Versalite programming

language greater than all Programming languages

in the world.It will work without any support of

any Programming language.Ojava7 is the 12 times

greater than web1.0 programming langauge.

Ojava7 is not a competitor to other programming

language.It's the competitor thought to attack

Ojava7. Because they don't like God jehovah,

Holysprit, and Lord Jesus christ.So Devil children

will always behave like this,and don't talk or believe them.

Ojava7 is my 3rd wisdom given by Lord jesus christ to me.

From this we understood Ojava7 P.L did not have any limitations.

 ABOUT  OJAVA7 with MachineLearning and  Datascience History
==============================================================

J@ framework from  J$part2 focused for Mathematical statistics and  Datascience.
and  such  concept is removed already  and  updated  in  oakjava7(Java7.0)...
and  now  only  mathematical  statistics concept  is  now found in j@  at  JDollarpart2..
So  J$ give his  concept to  Oakjava7.
Now JDollar(J$)  real  rank  is  Rank z'''.   
So  JDollar(J$)  use   machine learning and  datascience before python
uses  machine learning and  datascience.
Jdollar(J$),oakjava7 and  all other  writ  programming language
is  not  concenterated  in  AI  and  creating robots.

About OakJava7 Programming Language Divisions
==============================================

OakJava7 is  divided  into  6 types



i) Scroll Server with  Java/j2ee,Oakjava7, and Java (jdk1.8) compiler 

(Note: Here Oakjava7 compiler is not used,instead of that Jdk1.8 compiler is used
with ScrollServer.Because  Hibernate, Mybatics ,Java Spring are written in Jdk1.8 
That's why Oakjava7 compiler is not match with java/j2ee frameworks
Hibernate, Mybatics ,Java Spring ,and EJB. But Oakjava7 will
be  used  in case of providing security for Java/J2ee platform.
so Jdk1.8 versions and  next versions of  Jdk1.8 will not be
supported to be used with Oakjava7 compiler.
Here Jsp ,and Servlet will not work in Scroll Server.
but EJB and JMS will work. You can see the sample for hibernate in SAMPLES SECTION.
ie) In Oakjava7 google site.
(Sample-2:Topic: Write   a JAVA7.0 program  with Scroll Program,
here Jdk1.8 compiler is focused).
(We advice Java Spring should optimize the source code.So Java(jdk1.8) 
professionals are permited to be used with most popular server which is Scroll Server.
)

iii) Scroll Server with (.java7) with Oakjava7 (OAKJAVA7.0) compiler

iv) Machine Learning and  data Science with  UserFriendly frameworks (OJ7UA).

v) Oakjava7  Advanced Samples with  (.web) and  Oakjava7 Console Application.

vi) OakJava7  with Remote X Application (Advanced Application) ( Not released now, i will come later).




======================================================

Doubtful FAQS?
==============


1) Can oakjava7 compiler work  with  Jdk1.8 and java/j2ee frameworks ?

No.

2) Can Oakjava7 compiler compile Jdk1.8 programs ?

No, It will not accept jdk1.8 and other jdk1.8 versions.

3) Is Oakjava7  is the competitor of Java/J2ee?

No , Oakjava7 business is very different when compared

to Oracle business.

4) Is oakjava7 work as a Standalone application?

Yes, it will work without the help of Java/J2ee applications.


5) Is OakJava7 a high security Programming Language?

Yes.


===================================================================


Why Ojava7 is the best and top programming language than python p.l?
======================================================================

i) Both Oakjava7 and java/j2ee  is like  english fluent language.

but python is not a english fluent language.

ii) Using Oakjava7  we can reduce the  lines of code.

python is not  easy for the  developers to focus  when it reduce the lines of  code...

iii) Oakjava7 and Java/j2ee follow camel case and can be adjusted  at any style with beautiful arrangement 

using Intellij.But Python is failed in indentation.

iv) OakJava7 is an beautiful programming language with attractive syntax and with few lines of code than python programming Language.

v) OakJava7 module Oakjava8 is  best  in Mobile computing.



Note:

Oakjava7 author is not interested in Robot design (AI) field. Because Robotics 
belong to antichrist technology according to bibble book of revelation
Robotics should be eliminated from ArtificialIntelligence field.

Note:  
=====

As  only  1%  of   JAVA7.0(OAKJAVA7)   features  is  published  for
professionals  but  many  features  of  oakjava7(JAVA7.0)   is  hidden  from   users..
Since   they  may    copy    the  features   and  try  to  implement  it...

Oakjava7  is not  released  now. It has no  bugs.
OakJava7  will  come at  any time that you don't expect it.
In Oakjava7  first version itself  we will cover 
70%  the  concepts of  Machine learning and DataScience.
and  remaining concepts will be covered in OakJava7 second version.

About the OakJava7 Programming Language
=========================================

Note: I spent 5 years  to  Design and  create  the Oakjava7 programming language.
but unwanted hackers attack my website without any reason. That's why iam delayed.
Oakjava7(JAVA7.0) programming language is not easy to design and invent it. To invent 
Oakjava7 programming language  is very hard...
Oakjava7(JAVA7.0) programming language is the technology wisdom given by  God jehovah
to me. 

Difference between Java(Jdk1.8) and Oakjava7?
===============================================

Both Java and Oakjava7 is used in webapplication and
console application.But Java follows cloudcomputing
Oakjava7 follows Remote-X Application.Oakjava7 is
not used to create a software like VB.net and
Java Swing. Oakjava7 is used only with java frameworks like hibernate
and Mybatics, it is not used with Java Spring ,the reason is Java Spring code is
very bulk. This Java Spring web/ standalone application
is very slow when compare to Node.js,Oakjava7(JAVA7.0).
Oakjava7 is invented in Dotweb and java(jdk1.6).Java Spring
takes more time to develop a webapplication when compared to OakJava7,Node.js.
And Oakjava7 has Advanced datastructures when compare to Java(Jdk1.8).
eg) Pipe,Bag,etc.Remember OakJava7 is not the competitor for Java,C#,
python,etc. OakJava7 is an interactive programming language. Java is
not a interactive programming Language.Oakjava7 is used in MachineLearning,
Datascience,mobile application,and single page application.
It supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it is Learnable.
Oakjava7 follows attractive and beautiful Userfriendly framework
(.oj7ua).Oakjava7 follows Shortest  function Statements.OakJava7 is
focus on Code Security.Oakjava7 is used with WNOSQL Database which  
provides high security...Oakjava7 is a standalone programming
language.That is without help of any available java frameworks 
Oakjava7 will able to create  webapplication,etc.Oakjava7 is
a Pure OOPS Programming Language. And Java/j2ee is not a
Pure OOPS Programming Language.Oakjava7 saves  time and  cost
and OakJava7 is a highest securable programming language.
Oakjava7 will compile and run the Oakjava7 program
at the same time. but Java(Jdk1.8) can't do it.






Who may  focus OakJava7(JAVA7.0) ?
==================================
 For Oakjava7 ,oakjava7 machinelearning,oakjava7 datascience only C or  C++ or C# & Dotnet or Java/j2ee

Professionals or Google Professionals can focus and  read the samples. Because it is designed like this.

Note: All oakjava7  documents  are  under  construction.So don't read it now ,because it will confuse you.


Important Note:
================
This  GNUGPL3  license  is  for  only  Professional  Edition with  OakJava7 Tutorial. But  enterprise  edition  is  not  free that  is  MIT licensed. since
OakJava7(JAVA7.0) Programming Language  is a  World Rank A' Programming Language  and  it  is  dual Licensed invented  by  wilmix jemin j 
(Jemin Information Technology).




Note:
====
We are planning  to make  OakJava7 (JAVA7.0) programming language the  World Rank A'  programming  Language.
That means 12 steps  greater than  Web1.0 programming Language.
And We  are planning  to  make  Web1.0  Programming Language a  World NO:1 Programming  Language.
This arise due to competition.


Syntax for OakJava7 Machine Learning
=====================================


// Beginning of OakJava7 ML Program

 <OJ7ML> 

  
<DESIGN  



// Design is the HTML GUI or variable declarations or method declarations


SRC='

// Method declarations

public static void Methods1()
{




j7out.println("");






}



'> 


//Close Design for GUI

</DESIGN>	

//Mention name of Package value in Package always mention wnosql as a default value for the Database. 

// Mention OakJava7 library files for machine Learning  in J7Lib eg) Java7ML 

// Mention Package as ML , Names as sampleml1 for namespace name and class name as misctype1

// Mention Type as .exe or .dll 

<OakJava7 Package='ML' Database='wnosql' J7Lib='{Java7ML}' Names='sampleml1,misctype1' Type='exe'  




//Mention MAIN section for OakJava7 main program ie) public void main() can be  written as MAIN

// Mention what are the Business logic methods inside the main program eg) Methods1(),Methods2() in the MAIN section

 MAIN=' 


// Methods call

Methods1();
Methods2();









// This ( ?> ) is  equivalent to }}.Close the Main Section
?>
'
//LOGIC sections represent Business Logic for OakJava7
LOGIC=' 

  
//Business logic methods
public static void Method2()

{

<!----- write Business Logic and  use OakJava7 Servlet ----!>

}





// Close the Logic section
'>


// Close  the OakJava7 program 
</OakJava7>


// End of  Oakjava7 Program
</OJ7ML>





Explanation 
============

Here when you code the Machine Learning program  using this syntax, it will automatically convert to
Oakjava7 program ie(.web) . And you will get a optimized oakjava7 (.web) code and .exe and .ojava7 files.
You can also test the  OakJava7 Machine Learning program using (.web) code...So when we notice that here <OJ7ML> 
act like a OakJava7 user friendly framework. It act like a XML syntax with data present inside it.
This Machine Learning program (<OJ7ML) will automatically generate (.web). This (<OJ7ML>) 
program has attractive syntax.So it is considered as a OakJava7 advanced framework or 
OakJava7 Machine learning framework. I reduces the pain of writing program for (.web).
And It saves time and  cost.The Full form of <OJ7ML> program is "OAKJAVA7MACHINELEARNING". 
It is used for Dynamic Webpages construction ie) DB with GUI + Business Logic and OakJava7 Servlet.
We can also generate .dll  using this syntax by using .dll value as a Type.
So when you include .exe value as a Type means when you compile the oakjava7
it will generate the  .exe files and  .ojava7 files.
