**Welcome to OakJava7 Programming Tutorial**

OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) Tutorial
===========================

OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) Programming Language is  invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013,2016 in  java(jdk1.6) ,DOTWEB3.0. and OAKJAVA7(JAVA7.0) 
 is  a   World No:1 Programming Language and  it  is   focused  on   creating  Prototype  software,used  to  create Gaming and utilities, 
 used  in  web application  with  java frameworks , used  with  remote   webapplication  with  java frameworks,  and  it  has  Advanced Oops.
 It  also  supports obfuscation, Code Security, and it  is Learnable.
JAVA7.0   means   Jemin  Advanced  Virtual  Application.
JAVA7.0   is  even   Advanced   than  Python Programming  language...
JAVA7.0  will  replace Python programming language  in  Datascience  and  machine learning.



Definition:
==========

â€œJAVA7.0   is  meant   for  obfuscation, Code Security, Learnable, Prototype software, Advanced , used  in
Software  development, web application with machine learning ,remote web application , and  it  symbolizes  
STAR  symbol,  used  in  applications  like  Gaming  , used  with  java/j2ee  framework  like
Struts, spring , hibernate ,etc ".


                            

The Meaning of OAKJAVA7 or JAVA7.0 is OAK + Jemin Advanced Virtual Machine  OAK gives the meaning Beginning.


ABOUT JAVA7.0
=============


JAVA7.0 Programming  Language   is otherwise  known  as  OAKJAVA(JAVA7)
  which is  invented by  wilmix jemin  j  at  year  2013 in  java ,DOTWEB3.0.
This   two  versions  of  JAVA  (Jdk1.8,jdk1.7)  failed  that  is  using  JAD  decompiler  we  can   
easily  take   the  source   code.. But using oakjava7  we  can't take the code.
JAVA7.0  will  replace Python programming language  in  Datascience  and  machine learning.
We  felt   thanks  to my  best  friends  venkat  friend ,  github ,  and  all  for  their   support..


ADVANTAGES of JAVA7.0
=======================

a) JAVA7.0 behaves like his parent java and JDollar

java fails completly in code security. 

but java(jdk1.8,jdk1.7) is used with JREE in linux platform.

b) JAVA7.0 supports Garbage collection and explicity memory.

c) JAVA7.0 support Multiple inheritance ,friend function, and operator overloading

and all C/C++ oops concepts.

d) JAVA7.0 also supports CDollar concepts.

e) JAVA7.0 is used to create games which cannot be achieved in cdollar and gdollar.

f) JAVA7.0 also includes C# oops concepts.

g) JAVA7.0 also follows attractive syntax.

h) Since it had  100% oops concepts it is ranked as NO:1

Top quality software according to wilmixsolomonresearch lab.

i) JAVA7.0 is used with JDollar,CWEB section, JAVA, C#, and with all writ Programming languages.

Note: OakJava7  has  more  advantages than i  given  above..

 ABOUT  OAKJAVA7 with MachineLearning and  Datascience History
==============================================================

J@ framework from  J$part2 focused for Mathematical statistics and  Datascience.
and  such  concept is removed already  and  updated  in  oakjava7(Java7.0)...
and  now  only  mathematical  statistics concept  is  now found in j@  at  JDollarpart2..
So  J$ give his  concept to  Oakjava7.
Now JDollar(J$)  real  rank  is  Rank z'''.   
So  JDollar(J$)  use   machine learning and  datascience before python
uses  machine learning and  datascience.
So Oakjava7  will  replace  python  in machine learning and Datascience.
Jdollar(J$),oakjava7 and  all other  writ  programming language
is  not  concenterated  in  AI  and  creating robots.
but Python concenterated on this AI and  creating robots.




Note:  
=====

As  only  1%  of   JAVA7.0(OAKJAVA7)   features  is  published  for
professionals  but  many  features  of  oakjava7(JAVA7.0)   is  hidden  from   users..
Since   they  may    copy    the  features   and  try  to  implement  it...

Oakjava7  is not  released  now. It has no  bugs.
OakJava7  will  come at  any time that you don't expect it.
In Oakjava7  first version itself  we will cover 
80%  the  concepts of  Machine learning and DataScience.
and  remaining concepts will be covered in OakJava7 second version.
